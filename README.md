Big Red Pointers

This is a Mousecape port of Bill Myers' Big Red Pointers for Windows. I created this port for my own use, and am publishing it here in case anyone else also wants red mouse pointers for macOS.

The Windows mouse pointers are available at https://www.bmyers.com/public/high_visibility_cursors.cfm

NOTE: Bill Myers has graciously provided consent for his work to be ported to Mousecape. However, he is not responsible for supporting this port. If you have any questions, raise them here and not with Mr. Myers.
