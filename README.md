Big Red Pointers

This is a Mousecape port of Bill Myers' Big Red Pointers for Windows.

The original Windows mouse pointers are available at https://www.bmyers.com/public/high_visibility_cursors.cfm

Bill Myers has graciously provided consent for his work to be ported to Mousecape. However, he is not responsible for supporting this port. If you have any questions, raise them here and not with Mr. Myers.
